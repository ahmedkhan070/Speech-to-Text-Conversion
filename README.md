# Speech-to-Text using Wav2Vec2

This project demonstrates how to use the `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` pretrained model for converting speech to text. The model is part of the Wav2Vec 2.0 framework, which leverages a Transformer architecture for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This project also includes research on how audio waves are converted into text using this model.

## Introduction

Wav2Vec 2.0 is a state-of-the-art framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that uses self-supervised learning. This project uses the `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` pretrained model, which is trained on the Librispeech dataset. The model converts speech audio into text and can handle a wide variety of accents and dialects.

## Features

- Uses `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` pretrained model for speech-to-text conversion.
- Capable of handling different accents and dialects.
- Simple and efficient speech-to-text conversion process.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to use the speech-to-text model.
    ```bash
    python speech_to_text.py
    ```

2. **Provide Audio File**:
    - The script will prompt you to input an audio file containing speech.

3. **Receive Transcription**:
    - The system will transcribe the provided audio file and display the resulting text.

## How Waves Are Converted into Text

The Wav2Vec 2.0 model uses self-supervised learning to train on large speech datasets. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**:
    - The audio file is preprocessed, and features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or other audio features are extracted.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
    - The model extracts features from the audio signal, such as phonemes or representations of speech sounds.

3. **Transformer Encoding**:
    - The model uses a Transformer architecture to encode the audio features and learn contextual representations.

4. **Language Modeling**:
    - A language model is applied to the encoded representations to predict the most likely transcription for the input audio.

5. **Decoding**:
    - The model decodes the predictions into text, generating the transcription for the input audio.

## Code Explanation

- **speech_to_text.py**:
    - The script loads the pretrained `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` model.
    - It takes an input audio file, processes it, and uses the model to transcribe the audio into text.
    - The resulting transcription is then displayed.
